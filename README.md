Simple linux daemon to change gnome wallpaper every 20 secs.

Installation:

Clone the repo in your home.

Be sure to have your wallpapers in ~/Pictures/wallpapers
you can change this path in change_wallpaper.sh file.

Place wallpaper-engine-daemon.service in ~/.config/systemd/user
then inside this folder open terminal and do systemctl --user reload-daemon.

To enable daemon and start it do:
systemctl --user enable wallpaper-engine-daemon.service
then
systemctl --user start wallpaper-engine-daemon.service

that's all, now the wallpaper should change every 20 sec by default.

To change the time you can modify main.c and change the line with sleep(20) by any number
but you'll need to recompile the daemon and restart the service by doing:
systemctl --user restart wallpaper-engine-daemon.service
